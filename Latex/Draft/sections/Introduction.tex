\section{Introduction}

\todo[plan]{
This is the introduction.
It could explain the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mathematical relevance of CW complexes
    \item What is Lean and mathlib and why is it relevant
    \item Any related work (do CW complexes exist in other proof assistants?)
\end{itemize}

I think Floris was maybe going to write this?}
