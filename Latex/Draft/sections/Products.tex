\section{Products}\label{sec:products}

In general, the product of CW complexes is not actually is a CW complex because the weak topology of the CW complex might not match the product topology. \todo{mention term ``weak topology'' already somewhere in definition section (or even introduction?)}
A counterexample was first provided by \citeauthor{Dowker1952} in \cite{Dowker1952}.

In order to achieve the correct topology on the product space we need to turn it into a compactly generated space which we will discuss in the next subsection.

\subsection{Compactly generated spaces}

The name compactly generated space is used for different notions in the literature.
Firstly, it can refer to a space with a topology that is coherent with its compact subsets, i.e.\ a set is closed iff its intersection with every compact subset is closed in that subset. 
Secondly, it can refer to a space with a topology determined by continuous maps from compact Hausdorff spaces, i.e.\ a set is closed iff its preimage under every continuous map from a compact Hausdorff map is closed.

\todo[plan]{Talk about the three different definitions. Explain the naming?}

\subsection{Product of CW complexes}
\todo{What does one name this subsection?}

\todo[plan]{Give a fairly detailed mathematical proof of the product here (a little less detailed than in my thesis). I should probably start with a subsection on kspaces.}
