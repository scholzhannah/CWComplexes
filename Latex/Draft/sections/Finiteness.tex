\section{Finiteness notions}

\todo[plan]{talk about finiteness notions here, subsection in definition section?}

There are three important finiteness notions on CW complexes. 
We say that a CW complex is \emph{of finite type} if there are only finitely many cells in each dimension. 
We call it \emph{finite dimensional} if there is an $n$ such that the complex equals its $n$-skeleton.
Finally, it is said to be \emph{finite} is it is both finite dimensional and of finite type. 
In Lean these definitions take the following form: 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
class RelCWComplex.FiniteDimensional.{u} {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] 
    (C : Set X) {D : Set X} [RelCWComplex C D] : Prop where
  eventually_isEmpty_cell : ∀ᶠ n in Filter.atTop, IsEmpty (cell C n)

class RelCWComplex.FiniteType.{u} {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (C : Set X) 
    {D : Set X} [RelCWComplex C D] : Prop where
  finite_cell (n : ℕ) : Finite (cell C n)

class RelCWComplex.Finite.{u} {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (C : Set X) 
    {D : Set X} [RelCWComplex C D] : Prop where
  eventually_isEmpty_cell : ∀ᶠ n in Filter.atTop, IsEmpty (cell C n)
  finite_cell (n : ℕ) : _root_.Finite (cell C n)
\end{lstlisting}
