The formalized proof is constructive, and relies on nothing but the axioms and rules of the foundational framework implemented by Coq. To support the formalization, we developed a comprehensive set of reusable libraries of formalized mathematics, including results in finite group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, and the theories of the real and complex algebraic numbers.",
