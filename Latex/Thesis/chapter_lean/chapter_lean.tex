\chapter{Lean and mathlib}

In this chapter we will discuss some general concepts about Lean and its mathematical library mathlib. 
We will first explain the logic, i.e. the type theory that is used in Lean. 
While it is helpful to know some theory about it, it is not necessary to understand the type theory in depth to formalise mathematics in Lean or read and understand the rest of this thesis. 
Most important are some constructions, that are explained at the end of the following section, and how you can use them in practice.
