\subsection{Image of a homeomorphism}

Homeomorphism respect the CW-complex structure: 

\begin{lem} \label{lem:homeomorph}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and $f \colon X \to Y$ a homeomorphism. 
    If $X$ is a CW-complex with indexing sets $(I_n)_{n \in \bN}$ and characteristic maps $(Q_i^n)_{n \in \bN, i \in I_n}$ then $Y$ is a CW-complex with the same indexing sets and characteristic maps $(f \circ Q_i^n)_{n \in \bN, i \in I_n}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Properties (ii), (iii), (v) of definition \ref{defi:CWComplex2} follow easily from the fact that $f$ is a bijection. 
    Property (i) holds since we compose the characteristic maps with a homeomorphism. 
    Let us lastly look at property (iv), i.e. the weak topology. 
    We get: 
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            A \subseteq Y \text{ is closed} &\iff \preim{f}{A} \subseteq X \text {is closed} \\
            &\iff Q_i^n(D_i^n) \cap \preim{f}{A} = \preim{f}{(f \circ Q_i^n)(D_i^n) \cap A} \subseteq X \text{ is closed} \\ 
            &\iff (f \circ Q_i^n)(D_i^n) \cap A \subseteq Y \text{ is closed}.
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
